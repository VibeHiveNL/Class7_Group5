				<h4>User interface patterns</h4>
					<ul class="list-styled">
					<li>The structure of the <strong>navigation and content</strong> (e.g. how content units are distributed across pages)</li>
					<li><strong>Navigation: </strong></li>
						<ul>
							<li>For the purpose of this assigment we have created a limited website that includes the following pages</li>
							<ul>
							 <li>Home</li>
							 <li>Corporate</li>
							</ul>
						 <p>and 2 hidden pages reached through the "learn more" and "invest" buttons in the homepage. These are:</p>
							<ul>
							 <li><a href="events.html" target="_blank">Events</a> (hidden behind "learn more" button)</li>
							 <li><a href="payments.html" target="_blank">Payments</a> (hidden behind "invest" button)</li>
							</ul>
						<li><strong>Content</strong></li>
							<ul>
							 <li>All content units are distributed within the Home and the 2 hidden page.</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>
					<li><strong>Design Elements</strong></li>
						<ul class="list-styled">
							 <li>Carousel</li>
							  <p> we have chosen to use this highly visual element as the hero section of our Home page, as we believed to be an eye-catcher that would get the viewer attention and make them relate to the content.</p>
							 <li>2 Column Layout</li>
							 <p>the choice for this layout came from the idea of creating a second hero section on the right side, to keep the crowdfunding investments separate and highlighted at the same time.</p>
							 <li>Hover Pop-up Image</li>
							 <p>We chose for a pop-up image as an element to our crowdfunding buttons, to limitate the space utilized and still have a visual impact to what the viewer reads.</p>
						</ul>
					</ul>
					<p>The goal for us was to create a relaxed and calming feeling, that would allow the viewer to browse freely without feeling obliged to do anything.
					<br>We also wanted to create a website not catered to any culture in particular to push on our diversity value. The strong fonts are also following our inclusion value, as they are easy to read for the vast majority of users, including people with disabilities and those coming from non-latin-character' languages.</p>

					<h4 id="production-3" class="mt-2">Testing Report</h4>
					<p>The video to the testing can be found in Appendix 4.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Goals</strong>
						<ul>
						Our test goals were to find out if navigating within our website was easy and smooth. In this, we first asked people to just navigate through the website and then we came up with goals to find something, for example, that we were not sure was easy to find.</ul></li>
						<li><strong>Methods</strong><ul>
							<ul>
						<li><strong>Test Participants</strong></li>
						<ul>
							<li>Emily, 27 years old, from Germany.</li>
							<li>Sarah, 31 years old, from Belgium</li></ul></ul>
						<li><strong>Test Setting</strong>
							<ul><li>We conducted the test interviews on location, one of the interviews was on campus and the other was recorded during a real-life meeting.</li>
							</ul></li>
						<li><strong>Test protocol</strong><br>
							We first had the test participants navigate around the website. Then we gave different tasks such as and.</li>
							<ul>
							<li>"look for the prices of our events"</li>
							<li>"can you manage to find an image of the reward for donating"</li>
							</ul>
							</ul>
							After that we asked for more general feedback about the website.
						</li>
						<li><strong>Testing Results</strong><br>The testing resulted in a number of points where we could improve, here is a summary of these points:</li>
						<ul>
						<li>It is difficult to find the prices of the events.</li>
						<li>The rewards for the donations are clear for the first two options (it shows an image of it), but with the third and fourth options of donating, no images are given as examples.</li>
						<li>The images of 'Our Team' are not perfectly cropped in the oval shape causing some heads to be cut off.</li>
						<li>The test participants really appriciated the look-and-feel of the website.</li>
						<li>The test participants liked the pop-up image in the "invest" buttons.</li>
						<li>The test participants thought it was really easy to navigate through the website.</li>
						</ul>
						</ul>
						<li>To make improvements here, we have made the text of the event prizes larger so that it stands out more among the rest of the text.<br>
						  In the future we would like to add a hover pop-up image in the last 2 rewards and make sure that our team pictures are properly cropped.</li>
						<li><strong>Validator testing:</strong> after placing the website in the validator we realized that the &lt;center&gt; code in HTML is obsolete, and we should have used the CSS instead. Unfortunately we could not understand how to properly adjust this code in CCS so that it would show in the same way on the website. We are aware of this mistake, and with more time we would have found a sound solution.</li>
<!-- End Production, start Marketing -->
				<h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
					<h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
						<ul>
						<li>The campaign we had was to give people tips on how to be more social, we made three reels video where we would give tips on how to be more social when talking to someone, including one reel where we showed some hot spots in the Netherlands, so when you did eet someone new you could take them to an impressive spot. <br>
						Another campaign we had was “share your thoughts”. It was a campaign where we would post a quote related to being an expat and ask people to share their thoughts in our comments section. We had that campaign to  open up people talking about their feelings. People may connect trough feelings and relate to each other, so friendships can be made.
						<br>Our feel objectives was to make 45 people feel more connected to the country they moves to. With our campaigns we hope to open up more possibilities where people get to talk (longer)  to people from other cultures and share there thoughts, and get to know different impressive places in the country they move to. We hope to make people vibe in their hive. </li></ul>
					<h4>Used platforms</h4>
		  				<ul>
						<li>For this specific project we have chosen to be active on two social media platforms: Instagram and Facebook. During the research and the interviews, it emerged that the target group we focused on is mainly active on these social media platforms. On Facebook we focus on the Facebook groups where the expats are located. There are many groups where expats create a community and share things that are fun and useful for other expats. We can make good use of this by sharing our events and thus creating enthusiasm for it. 
						<br>In addition to Facebook, we are also active on Instagram. We mainly announce the events here and afterwards also post fun content about how the event was. We do this so that the target group may come to the next event. In addition to these posts, we also post 'Instagram reels'. In these short videos we give all kinds of useful tips that appeal to our target group, so that they build a connection with our brand sooner.</li></ul>

					</div>
						</div>
					<h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">marketing objectives</h4>
						<ul class="list-styled">
						<li><h6>Reach objective: Reach 550 people by May 10.2023.</h6> Facebook: Reach out to 50 people by May 10, 2023, using targeted Facebook advertising, groups, and pages.<br>Instagram: By May 10, 2023, engage with 500 individuals on Instagram using relevant hashtags, user-generated content, and influencer collaborations.</li>
						<li><h6>Interaction objective</h6>Social Media Interaction: By May 11, 2023, we need 175 individuals to interact with our social media content, such as liking, sharing, or commenting.</li>
						<li><h6>Feel objective</h6>Creating Connections: By May 12, 2023, help 50 people feel more connected to the country they have migrated to by creating and distributing meaningful content that emphasizes the country's beauty, culture, and history. Promote a welcoming attitude as well. </li>
						</ul>
					<h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
						<p>We learned the value of consistent and active social media posting during our campaigns. We discovered that posting consistency was not always simple to accomplish due to forgetfulness or incomplete content. We were also demotivated by the lack of viral response to our posts, which made us feel as if we were working for people who didn't care. We had particular difficulty gaining Facebook followers, even after repeatedly asking classmates to follow us.</p>
						<p>We discovered the effectiveness of popular hashtags and reels in increasing our reach. We discovered that reels had a higher potential to reach a larger audience, but producing high-quality reels was more difficult than regular posts. Despite the obstacles, we continued to create engaging content in order to draw in and keep followers.</p>
						<p>However, due to forgetfulness or a lack of motivation, we experienced setbacks in our social media planning. We intended to post every day, but only managed to do so for the first 1-2 weeks of the project. We discovered that planning content and setting alarms helped us stay on track with our social media planning. We were able to maintain our content calendar and avoid falling behind by planning content ahead of time and planning it for a specific day and time. </p>
						<p>Despite our rocky start, our proactive approach to social media planning and content creation enabled us to nearly meet our goal of reaching 500 expats by April 10, 2023, with 100 on Facebook and 400 on Instagram. While we did not post as frequently as we had hoped, our commitment to creating engaging content and maintaining a regular posting schedule allowed us to come close to meeting our target.</p>
					<h4 id="marketing-4" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
						<p>If the project were to run longer, we would do some things differently, like:  make sure that we schedule a day in which you have all the time to create different types of content and also to understand the message and idea behind it. Because the schedule was sometimes very tight, we had to quickly create content and the time pressure can reduce the quality.</p>
						<p>We can use the following strategies to improve social media campaigns:</p>
						<ol type="1">
						<li>Make a more detailed content calendar: preparing and organizing content (who is posting what) ahead of time can help us avoid last-minute pressure and ensure consistency in our posting. We can also schedule our posts in advance using tools like Hootsuite or Buffer.</li>
						<li>Set attainable goals: We should set attainable goals that are measurable. This can assist us in staying motivated and tracking our progress.</li>
						<li>Respond to comments and messages on our social media pages: responding to comments as well as messages on our social media pages can assist us build a relationship with our audience and a loyal following.</li>
						<li>Use analytics: We can track our performance and find ways to enhance it by using analytics tools offered by social media platforms. This can help us figure out what works and what doesn't for our target audience.</li>
						<li>Experiment with different types of content: To keep our audience engaged and interested, we should try various kinds of content such as videos, photos, polls, or quizzes. We can also try out different hashtags to broaden our reach.</li>
						</ol>
						<p>We can enhance our campaigns on social media and achieve our objectives by implementing these strategies.</p>

						<li><strong>Backstory</strong></li>
						<p>Sandy grew up in India, where she spent the majority of her time with her family. She has always been curious and eager to learn new things as she grew up. Sandy began working for a multinational corporation in India after completing her bachelor's degree in business administration.</p>
						<p>She discovered her future husband there, who also worked at the same company. They fell in love and decided to tie the knot. However, a few years after their marriage, Sandy's husband was offered a job in the Netherlands, and they were compelled to move abroad.</p>
						<p>Sandy was thrilled about the relocation and the prospect of beginning a new life in a new country. She quickly realized, however, that it was not going to be a simple task. Sandy found it difficult to connect with peers and integrate into the new society as a stay-at-home mom to their 7-year-old son. She felt like an outsider, struggling to fit in with the local culture.</p>
						<p>Sandy, as a minority, often felt disconnected from the crowd and had trouble finding others who shared her interests and values. She hoped for the comfort of her familiar environment and missed her loved ones back home. Sandy remained determined, despite her difficulties, to make a life that suited her and her family in the Netherlands.</p>
						<p>Sandy started attending local local events and joining various expat groups in order to overcome her challenges. She worked diligently to pick up the Dutch language and culture, and she sought out friends with similar interests. She also attempted to introduce her Indian culture to her new friends, refusing to deny her Indian heritage.</p>

						</ul>
					<h4 id="management-12" class="mt-2">Validation of Assumptions</h4>
					<p>Following our interviews (Appendix 2) we realized we were correct in our problem assumption on the following 2 points:</p>
						<ul>
						<li>Loneliness: we correctly assumed that the interviewees felt disconnected and lonely when they arrived in the country, and that they were seeking new connections</li>
						<li><strong></strong> we corretly assumed that the target audience felt a desire for integration with the new country' culture, they desired to find a safe space to lean and get in contact with locals.</li>
