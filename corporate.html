				<h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
					<h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
						<p>The campaign we had was to give people tips on how to be more social, we made three reels video where we would give tips on how to be more social when talking to someone, including one reel where we showed some hot spots in the Netherlands, so when you did eet someone new you could take them to an impressive spot. </p>
						<p>Another campaign we had was “share your thoughts”. It was a campaign where we would post a quote related to being an expat and ask people to share their thoughts in our comments section. We had that campaign to  open up people talking about their feelings. People may connect trough feelings and relate to each other, so friendships can be made. </p>
						<p>Our feel objectives was to make 45 people feel more connected to the country they moves to. With our campaigns we hope to open up more possibilities where people get to talk (longer)  to people from other cultures and share there thoughts, and get to know different impressive places in the country they move to. We hope to make people vibe in their hive. 
						</p>
					<h4>Used platforms</h4>
						<p>For this specific project we have chosen to be active on two social media platforms: Instagram and Facebook. During the research and the interviews, it emerged that the target group we focused on is mainly active on these social media platforms. On Facebook we focus on the Facebook groups where the expats are located. There are many groups where expats create a community and share things that are fun and useful for other expats. We can make good use of this by sharing our events and thus creating enthusiasm for it. </p>  
						<p>In addition to Facebook, we are also active on Instagram. We mainly announce the events here and afterwards also post fun content about how the event was. We do this so that the target group may come to the next event. In addition to these posts, we also post 'Instagram reels'. In these short videos we give all kinds of useful tips that appeal to our target group, so that they build a connection with our brand sooner.</p>
					<h4>Content calendar</h4>
						<img alt="Content Calendar" class="img-thumbnail" src="images/april.jpg">
						<img alt="Content Calendar" class="img-thumbnail" src="images/may.jpg">
					<h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">marketing objectives</h4>
						<ul class="list-styled">
						<li><h6>Reach objective: Reach 550 people by May 10.2023.</h6> Facebook: Reach out to 50 people by May 10, 2023, using targeted Facebook advertising, groups, and pages.<br>Instagram: By May 10, 2023, engage with 500 individuals on Instagram using relevant hashtags, user-generated content, and influencer collaborations.</li>
						<li><h6>Interaction objective</h6>Social Media Interaction: By May 11, 2023, we need 175 individuals to interact with our social media content, such as liking, sharing, or commenting.</li>
						<li><h6>Feel objective</h6>Creating Connections: By May 12, 2023, help 50 people feel more connected to the country they have migrated to by creating and distributing meaningful content that emphasizes the country's beauty, culture, and history. Promote a welcoming attitude as well. </li>
						</ul>
					<h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
						<p>We learned the value of consistent and active social media posting during our campaigns. We discovered that posting consistency was not always simple to accomplish due to forgetfulness or incomplete content. We were also demotivated by the lack of viral response to our posts, which made us feel as if we were working for people who didn't care. We had particular difficulty gaining Facebook followers, even after repeatedly asking classmates to follow us.</p>
						<p>We discovered the effectiveness of popular hashtags and reels in increasing our reach. We discovered that reels had a higher potential to reach a larger audience, but producing high-quality reels was more difficult than regular posts. Despite the obstacles, we continued to create engaging content in order to draw in and keep followers.</p>
						<p>However, due to forgetfulness or a lack of motivation, we experienced setbacks in our social media planning. We intended to post every day, but only managed to do so for the first 1-2 weeks of the project. We discovered that planning content and setting alarms helped us stay on track with our social media planning. We were able to maintain our content calendar and avoid falling behind by planning content ahead of time and planning it for a specific day and time. </p>
						<p>Despite our rocky start, our proactive approach to social media planning and content creation enabled us to nearly meet our goal of reaching 500 expats by April 10, 2023, with 100 on Facebook and 400 on Instagram. While we did not post as frequently as we had hoped, our commitment to creating engaging content and maintaining a regular posting schedule allowed us to come close to meeting our target.</p>
					<h4 id="marketing-4" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
						<p>If the project were to run longer, we would do some things differently, like:  make sure that we schedule a day in which you have all the time to create different types of content and also to understand the message and idea behind it. Because the schedule was sometimes very tight, we had to quickly create content and the time pressure can reduce the quality.</p>
						<p>We can use the following strategies to improve social media campaigns:</p>
						<ol type="1">
						<li>Make a more detailed content calendar: preparing and organizing content (who is posting what) ahead of time can help us avoid last-minute pressure and ensure consistency in our posting. We can also schedule our posts in advance using tools like Hootsuite or Buffer.</li>
						<li>Set attainable goals: We should set attainable goals that are measurable. This can assist us in staying motivated and tracking our progress.</li>
						<li>Respond to comments and messages on our social media pages: responding to comments as well as messages on our social media pages can assist us build a relationship with our audience and a loyal following.</li>
						<li>Use analytics: We can track our performance and find ways to enhance it by using analytics tools offered by social media platforms. This can help us figure out what works and what doesn't for our target audience.</li>
						<li>Experiment with different types of content: To keep our audience engaged and interested, we should try various kinds of content such as videos, photos, polls, or quizzes. We can also try out different hashtags to broaden our reach.</li>
						</ol>
						<p>We can enhance our campaigns on social media and achieve our objectives by implementing these strategies.</p>
